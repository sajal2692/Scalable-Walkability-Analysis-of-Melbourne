# Scalable-Walkability-Analysis-of-Melbourne-
Code and iPython notebooks for final semester computing project, for a Masters degree at the University of Melbourne.

My first data analytics project, with hands-off supervision from my supervisor at The University of Melbourne.

Different components and/or types of analyses are presented in the form of iPython notebooks, each one of with explanations
relevant to that component. 

Choropleth maps are available in the inside the choropleth-map directory, and should be downloaded to view.
